**UGCL** is an _Affinity Group Social_ event to be held in conjunction with EACL 2021 (the 16th conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics). This is the first edition of UGCL. The motivation behind organising this social stems from an informal zoom gathering the UGs had conducted among themselves in ACL 2020 (of which the organiser was a part). The sessions would be conducted on Zoom. Links would be shared over email.
