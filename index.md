In Session 1 students would be facilitated to network among themselves so that they get to know one another and build friendships early to connect during the conference. The second session would feature short talks from current grad students and corporate researchers, followed by a discussion session. Also, we are looking into the feasibility of organising 1:1 sessions between UG students and mentors. More details would be added to the agenda soon!
