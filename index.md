**UGCL** is an _Affinity Group Social_ event to be held in conjunction with [EACL 2021](https://2021.eacl.org/program/diversity/) (the 16th conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics).

## Agenda
The event comprises two sessions, details of which have been briefly outlined below:

* **Session 1 (19th April 1030 to 1200 HRS CET):** _Networking session_
* **Session 2 (20th April 1500 to 1600 HRS CET):** _Talks and QnA_

### Speakers
* **[Koustuv Saha](https://koustuv.com) (Georgia Tech):** Koustuv Saha is a doctoral candidate in Computer Science in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech. His research interests are in Social Computing and Computational Social Science. In his research, he adopts machine learning, natural language, and causal inference analysis to examine human behaviour and wellbeing using social media and online data, along with complementary multimodal sensing data. His work has been published at several high prestige venues, including CHI, CSCW, ICWSM, IMWUT, JMIR, TBM, ACII, FAT*, PervasiveHealth, and WebSci, among others. He has been recognized as Foley Scholar, a recipient of the Foley Scholarship Award, GVU Centerâ€™s highest recognition for student excellence in research contributions to computing. He is a recipient of the Snap Research Fellowship, a finalist of the Symantec Graduate Fellowship, and his research has won the Outstanding Study Design Award at ICWSM 2019. His research has been covered at prestigious media outlets, including the New York Times, CBC Radio, NBC, 11Alive, the Hill, and the Commonwealth Times. During his Ph.D., he has had research internships at Snap Research, Microsoft Research, Max Planck Institute, and Fred Hutch Cancer Research, with an overall industry experience of five years. Earlier, he completed his B.Tech (Hons.) in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur.

* **[Sohan Patro](https://sohanpatro.github.io/) (Microsoft Redmond):** Sohan Patro is a Software Engineer at Microsft Redmond, with a prior experiences in the role of a Data Scientist while working at Microsoft Research. He is an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur alumnus, with Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. He has been involved in several research projects in the course of his academia, including some in his research internships at ITRI, Taiwan, and Microsoft. He has also had research papers in venues like NAACL, ACL SocialNLP etc. He would love to share how his research interests started at academia and some pointers that may help in making the most out of your research endeavours, his experiences in his research internships and his recent exposures to corporate research in Microsoft R&D, along with some of it's pros and cons.

* **[Sopan Khosla](https://sopankhosla.github.io/) (Cargenie Mellon University)**

In Session 1 students would be facilitated to network among themselves so that they get to know one another and build friendships early to connect during the conference. The second session would feature short talks from current grad students and corporate researchers, followed by a discussion session. Also, we are looking into the feasibility of organising 1:1 sessions between UG students and mentors. More details would be added to the agenda soon!
