**UGCL** is an _Affinity Group Social_ event to be held in conjunction with [EACL 2021](https://2021.eacl.org/program/diversity/) (the 16th conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics).

#### Agenda
The event comprises two sessions, details of which have been briefly outlined below:

* **Session 1 (19th April 1030 to 1200 HRS CET):** _Networking session_
* **Session 2 (20th April 1500 to 1600 HRS CET):** _Talks and QnA_

## Speakers
* A
* B

In Session 1 students would be facilitated to network among themselves so that they get to know one another and build friendships early to connect during the conference. The second session would feature short talks from current grad students and corporate researchers, followed by a discussion session. Also, we are looking into the feasibility of organising 1:1 sessions between UG students and mentors. More details would be added to the agenda soon!
