**UGCL** is an _Affinity Group Social_ event to be held in conjunction with EACL 2021 (the 16th conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics).

### Agenda

The event would feature short talks from current grad students and corporate researchers, followed by a discussion session. Also, we are looking into the feasibility of organising 1:1 sessions between UG students and mentors.

### Organiser
**Sayan Sinha**: Recent graduate (2020) from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur.
